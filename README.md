# Redux quiz group project

This weeks project was a two day team collaboration to build a multiple choice quiz using Redux. We had to work as a team to use global state to render the quiz questions one at a time, and display the correct and incorrect answers for each question before moving on to the next one. We then had to present a summary at the end of the quiz.

## The problem

This is our first introduction to Redux so we wanted to be organised from the beginning.
First we planned our project by creating a sketch on [jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1wSg5Vkx1tkhAMkHmDc_wAoLRbMdgezljwdX2NNyC3wM/viewer?f=0), listing the visual components required. We then started by creating the quiz logic by mob programming, to ensure that the whole team had some exposure to the newly introduced useSelector and useDispatch hooks.

We managed to create a new global state variable which we used to control when to display the welcome page and control when the quiz starts.
As usual we used a mobile first design approach.

If we had more time we would of liked to have split up some of our components and moving the code into smaller ones.
